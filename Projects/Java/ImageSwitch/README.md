# Welcome to "Image Switch" - Educational Android App Project

Designed exclusively for students eager to delve into Android development, "Image Switch" is an instructive project that seamlessly integrates the use of intents to navigate between activities. This project emphasizes practical learning, offering two engaging activities that cover fundamental concepts and introduce students to the power of intents in Android app development.

### Activity 1: Switching SVG Images

In this initial activity, students will master the basics of handling SVG images while understanding the crucial role of intents in transitioning between different app functionalities. By utilizing a single activity, students will learn to structure and organize code effectively, all while gaining insight into the seamless integration of intents for a smooth transition between image-switching actions.

#### Learning Outcomes:

1. Understanding basic UI components and layouts.
2. Implementing button click listeners and event handling.
3. Utilizing intents to navigate between different activities.
4. Loading and displaying SVG images efficiently within an activity.

### Activity 2: Dynamic Color Change

Moving on to the second activity, students will further enhance their skills by dynamically changing the color of a single SVG image. Through this exercise, they will solidify their understanding of intents and learn to use them for smooth transitions between activities, enabling a seamless shift from image-switching to color manipulation.

#### Learning Outcomes:

1. Programmatically changing the color of SVG images.
2. Exploring and applying graphics manipulation techniques.
3. Reinforcing skills in UI development and user interaction.
4. Gaining insight into the use of color resources and handling color states.
