# Welcome to the "ContextMenuScrollingText" Android app 
An instructive project designed to showcase the implementation of a ScrollView to display text and the integration of a context menu for enhanced user interactions. This educational app provides users with the ability to vertically scroll through the text content. Additionally, a context menu with options such as Edit, Share, and Delete becomes accessible through a long click on the TextView, enriching the user experience with additional functionalities.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **ScrollView Implementation:** Students will gain practical insights into implementing a ScrollView, allowing users to scroll vertically through text content that exceeds the available screen space.

2. **Context Menu Integration:** The project demonstrates how to integrate a context menu triggered by a long click on the TextView. This introduces students to the concept of context menus and their application in Android development.

3. **Menu Options Handling:** Students will learn how to handle menu item selections, specifically Edit, Share, and Delete, within the context menu. This involves displaying Toast messages to provide users with feedback regarding their chosen menu option.

## Project Highlights:

1. **Interactive ScrollView:** The app features an interactive ScrollView, enabling users to smoothly scroll through lengthy text content with a swipe gesture.

2. **Context Menu Implementation:** Upon a long click on the TextView, a context menu with Edit, Share, and Delete options becomes accessible, showcasing the versatility of context menus in enhancing user interactions.

3. **Toast Messages:** The project uses Toast messages to inform users about their selected context menu option, providing immediate and clear feedback.

4. **Practical Application:** The "ContextMenuScrollingText" app serves as a practical example of combining ScrollView and context menus to create a user-friendly and feature-rich text display.

##### explore the implementation of ScrollView, context menus, and handling user interactions with menu options. This project is tailored to provide students with practical experience in creating dynamic and interactive Android applications.
