# Welcome to the "RandomNumPuzzel" Android app

A dynamic and educational project created to guide students in Android development. This app challenges users to guess a randomly generated number, providing an engaging way to learn about Math.random and reinforcing essential concepts in Android app development.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **Random Number Generation:** Students will gain hands-on experience in utilizing the `Math.random` method to generate random numbers. Understanding how to incorporate randomness into an app is a valuable skill in game development and other interactive applications.

2. **User Input Handling:** The project encourages students to implement logic for handling user input as they attempt to guess the randomly generated number. This involves capturing and processing user guesses to determine the outcome of the game.

3. **Toast Message Display:** The app employs toast messages to provide feedback to users regarding the success or failure of their guess. This aspect reinforces the importance of effective communication within an app.

## Project Highlights:

1. **Random Number Challenge:** Users are presented with the exciting challenge of guessing a randomly generated number, fostering engagement and interaction with the app.

2. **Math.random Implementation:** The project introduces students to the `Math.random` method, demonstrating its usage in generating random numbers for various applications.

3. **Hands-On Coding Experience:** Students actively participate in coding to implement the logic for generating and comparing random numbers, deepening their understanding of programming concepts.

4. **Practical Application:** The "RandomNumPuzzel" app showcases a practical application of random number generation, providing a tangible example of how Math.random can be used in real-world scenarios.
