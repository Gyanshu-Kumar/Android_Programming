# Welcome to the "RotateImage" Android app 
An interactive and educational project designed for students to explore image manipulation and user interaction. This app allows users to dynamically select an image from their device using an image picker. Once the image is selected, users can rotate it using buttons corresponding to left, right, top, and bottom directions.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **Image Picker Implementation:** Students will learn how to incorporate an image picker to allow users to dynamically select an image from their device. Understanding how to utilize the image picker enhances their skills in handling user interactions.

2. **ImageView Manipulation:** The app provides a practical example of manipulating an ImageView, demonstrating how to rotate an image dynamically based on user input. This involves updating the rotation angle and redrawing the ImageView.

3. **Button Click Handling:** Students will gain experience in handling button clicks to trigger specific actions. In this case, buttons for left, right, top, and bottom rotations will serve as interactive elements.

## Project Highlights:

1. **Dynamic Image Selection:** The app utilizes an image picker, allowing users to select an image dynamically from their device. This feature enhances user engagement and adds a dynamic element to the app.

2. **Interactive Image Rotation:** Users can rotate the selected image in four directions – left, right, top, and bottom – by interacting with the corresponding buttons. This interactive feature showcases the versatility of ImageView manipulation.

3. **Hands-On Coding Experience:** Students actively participate in coding to implement image handling, rotation logic, and button click handling. This hands-on experience deepens their understanding of Android app development.

4. **Practical Application:** The "RotateImage" app provides a practical application of image manipulation, demonstrating how to incorporate user-selected images and apply dynamic transformations.


##### explore the exciting possibilities of ImageView manipulation, image selection, and user interaction in Android app development. This project is designed to provide students with practical insights into essential concepts while making the learning experience interactive and engaging.
