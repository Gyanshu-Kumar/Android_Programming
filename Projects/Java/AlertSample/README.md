# Welcome to the "AlertSample" Android app 
 An interactive and instructional project designed to introduce users to the implementation of alerts and toast messages in Android development. This simple yet effective app provides a button that, when tapped, triggers an alert with OK and Cancel buttons. Upon tapping either button, a corresponding toast message is displayed, offering users a clear understanding of the interaction.
