# DialPhone Android App

Welcome to the "DialPhone" Android app â€“ a straightforward and practical application that allows users to dial a phone number directly from the app. This app utilizes runtime permissions to request the CALL_PHONE permission and ensures a smooth user experience.


### Learning Objectives:

1. **Runtime Permissions:** Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and handling runtime permissions, a crucial aspect of Android development introduced in Android 6.0.

2. **Intent Usage:** The app showcases the usage of Intent to initiate a phone call using the ACTION_CALL action.

3. **Toast Messages:** Toast messages are used to provide feedback to the user, such as when there's no app available to make a call or when permission is denied.

### App Functionality:

1. **Phone Number Input:**
   - Users can input a phone number into the EditText field provided in the app.

2. **Making a Call:**
   - Upon tapping the "Make Call" button, the app checks for the CALL_PHONE permission.
   - If the permission is granted, the app initiates a call to the specified phone number.
   - If the permission is not granted, the app requests permission from the user.

3. **Runtime Permission Handling:**
   - The app dynamically handles runtime permissions, ensuring compatibility with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above.

4. **Log Information:**
   - The app logs the dialed phone number for reference.
