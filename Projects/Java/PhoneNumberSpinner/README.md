# Welcome to the "PhoneNumberSpinner" Android app
An intuitive project designed to facilitate the labeling of phone numbers through a spinner. This practical application enhances user experience by allowing users to set labels for phone numbers. Users can tap the phone number field to enter a number and then utilize the spinner to assign a label. The text field dynamically displays both the entered phone number and the selected spinner label, providing a seamless and organized way to manage phone contacts.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **Spinner Integration:** Students will gain hands-on experience in incorporating a spinner within an Android app, specifically for the purpose of selecting labels associated with phone numbers.

2. **User Input Handling:** The project demonstrates how to handle user input for phone numbers, allowing users to tap the phone number field and enter a numerical value.

3. **Dynamic UI Update:** Students will learn how to dynamically update a text field to display both the entered phone number and the selected label from the spinner.
