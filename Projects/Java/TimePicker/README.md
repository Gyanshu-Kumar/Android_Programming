# Welcome to the "TimePicker" Android app
An informative project designed to showcase the implementation of a Time Picker. This educational app provides users with the ability to set a specific time by tapping the "Time" button, utilizing the Time Picker. After selecting a time and clicking "OK," the app displays a Toast message on the main screen, showcasing the chosen time. Additionally, the selected time is dynamically displayed in a TextView, enriching the user experience.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **TimePicker Integration:** Students will gain hands-on experience in incorporating a Time Picker within an Android app, allowing users to easily set a specific time.

2. **UI Interaction:** The project demonstrates how to trigger the Time Picker by tapping a button and capture the selected time. It also showcases the importance of providing users with immediate feedback through Toast messages.

3. **Dynamic TextView Update:** Students will learn how to dynamically update a TextView with the selected time, demonstrating the integration of UI components based on user interactions.

4. **TimePickerFragment Implementation:** The app employs the TimePickerFragment class, extending DialogFragment and implementing TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener. This enhances modularity and structure, allowing for clean separation of dialog creation and handling the time set event.

## Project Highlights:

1. **User-Friendly Time Selection:** The app features a user-friendly interface that enables users to set a time effortlessly using the Time Picker.

2. **Toast Message Display:** Upon confirming the selected time, the app displays a Toast message on the main screen, providing users with instant feedback.

3. **Dynamic TextView Update:** The selected time dynamically updates the TextView on the main screen, showcasing real-time changes in the app's UI.

4. **Practical Application:** The "TimePicker" app serves as a practical example of integrating UI components such as Time Picker and Toast messages to create a user-centric and responsive Android application.

5. **Modular Dialog Handling:** The implementation of TimePickerFragment demonstrates the use of modular and clean code for handling time picker dialogs, promoting good coding practices
